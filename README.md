## Anime Supaida - a spider that crawls for anime data

[Myanimelist](https://myanimelist.net/anime/) is the #1 source for anime data

Testing out scrapy framework, and thought to myself whats worth scaping that would be fun, and also useful

I love anime. also, myself and other fans can benefit from the data.

### Todo

- Scrape per Genre
- Start off with Action and walk down the list

You can find the data (JSON/CSV) in the [data](./animesupaida/data/) folder

## Now, let the scraping begin! (cue in evil laugh) [muahahahaha]
